This project automates file downloads, backups, and email notifications through a user-friendly GUI interface built with Tkinter. Key functionalities include scheduling tasks to run daily, with error handling for robust execution.

Key Features:
File Download: Automatically downloads files from a specified URL to a user-defined directory.
File Backup: Backs up files from a source directory to a destination directory.

Main Steps:
User Input: Users enter details like the file URL, download directory, backup source/destination, email information, and the desired schedule time.
Scheduled Job Creation: Based on the user input, a scheduled job is created that will run daily at the chosen time.
Task Execution: When the scheduled time arrives, the tasks are executed in sequence:
File is downloaded.
Files are backed up.
An email notification is sent upon completion.
Error Handling: The code includes exception handling to manage any issues that may arise during the process.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
GUI Framework: Built using Tkinter to provide an intuitive interface for task scheduling.
User Interaction: Includes labeled input fields for file paths, directories, email details, and schedule time. Buttons allow for easy navigation and scheduling.
Real-time Scheduling: Users can set a daily time for the tasks to be automatically executed.
This project streamlines the process of downloading files, backing them up, and notifying users via email, all while being accessible through an easy-to-use GUI.
